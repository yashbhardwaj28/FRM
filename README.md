# Fraud Risk Management System For UPI Transactions

This Project is mainly focused on the fraud risk management of UPI transactions which generates a risk score on that basis the customer's bank decides whether the transaction which is made by customer should be flagged as fraud or not. 
In this project there is datbase integration with the jupyter notebook using python was done and a database was created using MS SQL Server 2019 using the data which we had with me in an Excel File Format.
Further the code in the "Final file" was deployed using the AWS cloud environment and the "lambda file" was created to transfer the data using API in the backend and a risk was generated by the model and POSTMAN was used to execute the API.
